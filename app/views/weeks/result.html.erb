<h1> Results (beta) </h1>
<h2> SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION </h2>
<p>
	Results below should be accurate, but need to be checked. You can check your
	own results - points for correct picks are in red, your total is in blue. Please email any discrepancies to fbphq@yahoo.com
	 The game headers have your picks in the larger font and the winning team in red. Points in the body of the table are underlined for away team picks.

<p>Thanks for your patience while we get this figured out</p>
